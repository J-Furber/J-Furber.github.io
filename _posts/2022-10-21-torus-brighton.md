## Update on Presentations - Brighton and ToRUS

It has been a while since I have updated you all on any presentations that I have done, but time seems to be going fast, and I have been focusing on getting my Confirmation completed (good news - I passed)! There have been two events that I have been too lately to present to my peers.

Firstly, on the 14th of October the research group in the Vet School (Neglected Tropical Diseases, NTD) organized an away day to discuss policy in research. 

It certainly was nice to visit Brighton for the day. At the event, we had the opportunity to deliver a 5-minute presentation on our work and how policy ties in. With my work, I would say there is no direct link to policy, but further work could link to policy of badgers.

A few weeks later (21st October), I presented at the Taste of Research for Undergraduate Students (ToRUS), where undergraduate students are invited to listen to postgraduate students talk about their work. 

I had planned to give a thirty-minute presentation, but I think I was that nervous, I got through it in fifteen minutes. Not ideal, and there were lots of questions afterwards, which I felt like I struggled with. But, everyone gave positive feedback afterwards, which was nice. It was certainly good practice for my Confirmation Viva that would be happening in a few weeks after this presentation.

Both were good experiences, and it will be interesting to see where I present next.
