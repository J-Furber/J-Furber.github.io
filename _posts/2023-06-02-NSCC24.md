## The National Student Chapter Conference Oxford 2023

After last years success in Edinburgh, I knew I wanted to attend the NSCC again this year. I found the application for the conference on Twitter and applied straight away for a talk (since I did a poster last year). I also promoted it to my peers as I enjoyed it so much last year. 

Within a month it was confirmed … I shall be presenting! I thought this is a great opportunity and a chance to practice my presentation skills as this would be the first time presenting to people outside the university. 

The time to travel was coming up and there were train strikes … again! So, by car we go to Oxford, to arrive for the Thursday morning before the conference. Nice and easy, with not much traffic on the M25. Rachel and my talks were on the first day and Elliott had the poster presentation in the evening. 

Happy to say, I felt my presentation went very well! I had a lot of positive feedback and lots of people saying they really enjoyed it! I even had someone endorse me on LinkedIn for my communication skills, which was very unexpected. 

The conference went along like last year and it was great fun. (We will skip over the stay in an Oxford, in essence, don’t stay at the Athena Guest Hotel). Another success, and I look forward to the next NSCC!
