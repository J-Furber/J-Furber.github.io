## Trip to Woodchester Park

Where would I be if I am doing a PhD on badgers and didn’t actually go and see some? 

So where better to go then the place that is supplying me with data? So off I set on the 6th December to Gloucestershire from Surrey. I headed straight to Woodchester Park, where this long term study is taking place. I thought I might as well have a walk around the park first before I was due to be there the next day. Being National Trust, it is a well kept place and certainly a nice place to go for a walk. I was quite lucky at the start of the walk, but then as British weather does, the heavens opened and I managed to get back to the car before I was too wet.

Then, I made my way to the hotel to check in, and then went out in search of food. I ended up in a pub called ‘The Old Badger Inn’ in Stonehouse, which I thought that it fitted quite well with the nature of my project. Either way, it was an early night for me as I had to be up at the break of dawn to meet Dez at Woodchester Park to go look at the badgers.

It is at this time of year where one of these capture events happen. This is where they set out some traps across the park to capture some badgers, which would then be tested for bTB and injuries. A [study that has been happening since the 1970s](https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/Media_538509_smxx.pdf). In recent years they have started to add a collar to the badgers with a GPS tracker so they are able to analyse the movements and behaviours of the badgers.

I met Dez at the car park at 7am on 7th December, where another PhD student from a different university and their supervisor and me got into Dez’s Range Rover. A more suitable vehicle to go through the park then the hired car that I had. We headed to the first sett where a trap had been set, and with success, one badger had been caught - a male cub. We then moved to the other sett, with a little walk up a hill, with success again, a badger had been caught - another male cub. So there was at least two badgers for this capture event.

We then drove back to the carpark to fetch our cars, and then followed Dez to the office. Set just next to Woodchester Park, it was in a good location to the badgers. Once there, we were able to go and watch the tests that they do on the badgers, where they are put under general anaesthesia. They take all necessary measurements of the badger, including checking for any injuries and taking fluids to test for bTB. A very interesting procedure and something that the general public do not get to see. 

To end the experience, we went back to the office and discussed what we had seen and what our research was about and how the data can help. The trip definitely helped me visualise how the data is collected - a step that (maybe) many mathematician researchers don’t see. Overall, a great trip and I am hopeful to go back again later in my project.
