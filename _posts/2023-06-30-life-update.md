## Life Update - June 2023

Itâ€™s been a while (November last year exactly) when I gave an update on my work and life so it is long overdue. Life has been so busy that this was placed on the back burner. So what has happened in my life since then?

Firstly, I went on a cruise in December with Tom and his family. From Southampton to south Spain and then back again in 14 days. It was a great adventure and a lot of fun!

Then, with no doubt, I have been to see ðŸŽ¶ musicals ðŸŽ¶ (and some plays). I have been to see Hamilton as part of a friends Christmas/birthday present. I have also been to see &Juliet, To Kill a Mockingbird, and Shawshank Redemption. Everyone of them was amazing!

My running news is great too! I completed the Surrey Half in March, and went to watch and cheer at the London Marathon for Girlguiding. Since, I have gained a charity place for the London Marathon next year for Anthony Nolan! This is going to be a great challenge. A more recent challenge, was participating in the Endure24 in Reading (10-11 June). This was a 24 hour running event, and I was on a team of 5 for PPC. I completed 6 laps, which is 30 miles (and did Parkrun on the Saturday morning too). Crazy to say the least! But I enjoyed it and contemplating to do it again next year!

I think other than that, my life is pretty much the same and just as busy but I wouldnâ€™t have it any other way!
