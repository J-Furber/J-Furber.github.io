## My First Conference

The time was approaching for me to attend my first conference, and which conference better to start with than the British Applied Mathematics Colloquium (BAMC)? This year it was held at Loughborough University on the 11th to 13th April, so it made Easter feel like an extended holiday. Though I don't think Loughborough will be on many people's holiday lists.

Joined by my fellow researchers, we had a fab few days. There were lots of interesting talks and an evening for poster presentations. Whilst not presenting anything myself, since it was my first, there were lots to take in. Including some talks by my friends on crime rates in London and influenza. Looking forward to my next conference where I am hoping to present something, wherever that may be.
