## University of Surreyâ€™s First PGR Mathematics Conference

I have been to a few conferences in my first year, and now it was my time to be on the organising committee for one. It was decided amongst the PGRs that we wanted a day conference to talk about our work to other members of staff within the department and our peers. Hence, a day event dedicated just to this.

The planning started back in December 2022 with the plan to host the day on 29 March 2023. The day being a Wednesday, so we knew there was little to no teaching, so academics should be able to attend. Little to our knowledge when organising things back in December, this was also going to be the day for the Board of Studies and a staff student liaison meeting. But we did not let this get us down.

The planning also included creating a budget, as the department was paying for it, and organising food and speakers. A deadline was set for people to submit an abstract, in which the committee chose the best one from each research group. This was to ensure there was a mix of work being shown, and not just one research group. 

The day itself was a success, with 4 student talks, 4 posters and a post doc talk from a previous PhD student from the university.  With the department paying for the posters, and for them to be put up on the wall, I would say it was a very successful event and something we hope will continue in the future.
