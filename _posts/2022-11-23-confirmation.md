## Confirmation Viva ... Smashed it!

The long wait between submitting my confirmation report and completing the viva is now over. I did not think I would be so nervous, but I was feeling it on the day. Everyone was reassuring me that I would be fine and no doubt in that I could do it.

So, the day arrives - 23rd November 2022. I think I have done enough planning and reading. I practised my presentation with a friend, and had gone over it multiple times. Hopefully, little could go wrong.

I made sure I was in the room twenty minutes beforehand to make sure the technology was working okay, as I had my supervisor joining over zoom. I think everyone knows of the struggles of technology these days, even with the multitude of practice from the past three years. 

My examiners arrived promptly and we were off. I think I took about 15 minutes on my presentation (I didn't time it specifically and the clock in the room was broken), but I think I remembered to speak slow.

And then came the questions. I was told to prepare from some technical questions on coherent sets, but luckily they were not bad. More confirming what I had written, so it was quite nice. I had some nice comments as well, where one examiner mentioned how it was one of the best reports that they had read!

About an hour and a half later, I was sent out the room whilst the examiners discuss all that was said and written. And the wait begins again. I went and got some chocolate to help calm myself. Five minutes later, they called me back in, and smiles all round. I had passed! Such a great feeling. 

They asked how I was going to celebrate, and I had not actually thought about it. So I suggested to Tom to go out for dinner to the Horse and Groom in Merrow, close to where we live. It was a pricey place, but luckily for Black Friday, I had 50% off adult mains. Hence, two fillet steaks for us, and it was delicious. One of the best steaks I have ever had. So, definitely worth it and would recommend to anyone. I would be happy to pay the full price too, as it was that good!

Overall, a good end to the day and a promising time for my project.
