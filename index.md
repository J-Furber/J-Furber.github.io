This site is following my PhD Journey into my time as an early career researcher.

I started to write this in my third year!

The site includes presentations I have done and conferences I have attended.

## About Me

I am a PhD student in the School of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Surrey, joint with the School of Veterinary Medicine. I have been doing research into the movements of badgers. My main research interests include:
