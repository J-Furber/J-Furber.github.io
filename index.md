This site is following my PhD Journey.

I have started to write this in my third year!

The site will include presentations I have done and conferences I have attended.


## About Me

I am a PhD student in the School of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Surrey. I am currently doing research into the movements of badgers. My main research interests include:
- Understanding the movement of badgers through a variety of mathematical tools.
- Have a brief understanding into how this can affect the transmission of bTB. 

Further details about some of my current work are available to read [here](/assets/FURBER_Confirmation_Report.pdf).

Below are some recent presentations of my research, along with a list of academic and funding awards that I have recieved.

## Recent Presentations

- 18th July 2023 - 5-minute lightning talk at the [summer school on mathematics of movement](https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/mmvw01/) at the Issac Newton Institute (Cambridge) and poster presentation
- August 2023 - **_Invited_** to the Isaac Newton Institute to particpate in the programme the [Mathematics of Movement (MMV)](https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/mmv/).

- 16th January 2024 - Oral Presentation at the Mathematics & Physics PGR Conference at the University of Surrey. _This is an internal, school event (increased from just the department), to allow the PGRs in the mathematics and physics departments to showcase their work. I was on the organising comittee for the event._

## Awards
